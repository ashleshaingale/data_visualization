## CIS 9655 - Data Visualization

### Project Proposal: Visualizing Global Startup Growth and Investment Trends

#### Topic: Analysing Global Startup Funding Patterns Using Crunchbase Data

#### Background and Introduction: 
Startups have become such a huge part of the global economy from innovative tech solutions to new-age healthcare and sustainable energy ideas, they’re constantly reshaping industries. But behind every successful startup is a story of funding the right investment at the right time often makes all the difference between a startup that thrives and one that fades away.

In this project, we want to dive deep into how funding flows into startups, which sectors attract the most capital, and whether early investments really shape long-term success. With so much data available, it’s not just about numbers it’s about telling the story of how startups grow and how investors place their bets.

Through data visualizations, we want to uncover these patterns and present insights in a way that’s easy to understand even for someone who isn’t deep into data analysis. The goal is to create a clear and engaging visual narrative around how the startup ecosystem operates, using real investment data.

#### Hypothesis:
Startups in technology-driven sectors like software, fintech, and healthtech receive higher funding amounts across all stages compared to traditional industries. Additionally, startups that raise larger funding amounts in their initial stages (Seed, Series A) are more likely to secure follow-on funding and eventually reach later stages like Series C, D, or even IPO.
